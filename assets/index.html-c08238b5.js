This package contains the TuxCare repo definitions, TuxCare GPG key and the <code>tuxctl</code> setup tool. Run the following as root:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code># dnf install -y https://repo.tuxcare.com/tuxcare/tuxcare-release-latest-$(rpm --eval %almalinux).noarch.rpm

ESU delivers an extension of an additional 4.5 years of security fixes for Critical and High-risk vulnerabilities as well as FIPS-compliant security patches for select AlmaLinux minor versions. The service is currently available for AlmaLinux 9.2 with planned support for AlmaLinux 9.6 and 9.10.

Our severity rating system for patching vulnerabilities integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available). When the vendor&#39;s score is lower than the NVD score, we give priority to the NVD score. ESU provides security patches for High and Critical vulnerabilities (with a 7+ CVSS score) and urgent priority bug fixes.

For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all &#39;High&#39; vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare organizations or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements. We aim to deliver security patches for Critical and High-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 7+) within 14 days from when the vulnerabilities become publicly disclosed.
