# TuxCare


The TuxCare services automate, simplify, and enhance Linux operations, giving organizations more flexibility in managing Linux distro choices and versions, significant maintenance cost reductions, and greatly enhanced security and compliance postures.


TuxCare, which is an expansion of the CloudLinuxâ€™s KernelCare and Extended Lifecycle Support brands, helps organizations take care of support, maintenance, and security for Enterprise Linux systems.

With [TuxCare Live Patching Services](/live-patching-services/), Linux kernels, libraries, databases, virtualizations and IoT devices receive automated security patches applied with zero downtime.

Using the [TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support](/extended-lifecycle-support/) services, you can migrate to the newest version of Linux at your own pace while maintaining protection from the common risks of running an end-of-life distro.

[Enterprise Support for AlmaLinux](/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/) provides a TuxCare-vetted repository of AlmaLinux updates with 16 years of support coverage, delivers an extension of an additional 4.5 years of security fixes for Critical and High-risk vulnerabilities and FIPS-compliant security patches for select AlmaLinux minor versions, minimizes vulnerability windows with rebootless security patches and helps to avoid costly upfront support package fees with pay-as-you-go hourly support bundles.

TuxCare provides the AlmaLinux community with FIPS 140-3 certification for AlmaLinux 9.2. Organizations requiring FIPS-certified AlmaLinux deployments or those operating under compliance regimes with similar requirements (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA) can download and install [FIPS-validated cryptographic packages for AlmaLinux 9.2](/enterprise-support-for-almalinux/fips/) (including the kernel and OpenSSL) for free.
